## Troubleshooting compile errors


| Problem | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| __CMake error:__ No CUDA toolset found / CUDA_ARCHITECTURES is empty for target "cmTC_0c70f" | __Windows:__ the Visual Studio CUDA integration was not installed correctly. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2/issues/103#issuecomment-618378963) to fix the problem without re-installing CUDA. ([#18](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/18)) |
| | __Linux:__ Environment variables for your CUDA installation are probably incorrectly set. You may work around the issue using ```cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-<your cuda version>/bin/nvcc``` ([#28](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp/issues/28)) |
